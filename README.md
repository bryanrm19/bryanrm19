### 📂 Featured Projects

### **AI Mockup-to-Code Converter**
**Repository:** [github.com/bryanrm19/ui-gen](https://github.com/bryanrm19/ui-gen)
* **Technologies**: React.js, OpenAI GPT-4o (Vision).
* Developed an intelligent system that transforms hand-drawn UI sketches and digital wireframes into functional, working prototype in seconds.
* Integrated with **OpenAI Vision APIs** to analyze spatial relationships, labels, and UI components from user-uploaded images.
* **Key Features**: 
    * **Real-time Code Generation**: Simultaneously produces clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structured for modern web standards.
    * **Interactive Preview**: Features a side-by-side live rendering engine allowing users to "Run Changes" and see code edits reflected instantly.
    * **Framework-Agnostic Generation**: Utilizes a prompt-driven logic to map sketches to Bootstrap UI (or another). The underlying system is UI-agnostic, meaning the generated code can be pivoted to any framework simply by adjusting the AI's instructional context.
    * **Developer Workflow Tools**: Includes one-click "Copy to Clipboard" and easy image swapping for rapid iterative design-to-code cycles.
